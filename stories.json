Finally she realizes and she throws the pen in a fire. The father figure realizes and gets very angry. The father starts to turn into a fiery devil. I run to the bathroom to escape him. It is pitch black in the small bathroom. I don't know why, but the devil begins chanting infanticide over and over.",

        "Weird Meat Travellers. Rode the bus with two friends trying to find our hotel. In the bus showing some strangers some magic tricks, but i didn't know many. They were only somewhat impressed. The muscle pass didn't really work well since I'm out of practice and my callous is gone. We were not sure which stop to use, but we got off eventually. While walking through a mall with a stranger who was helping us find our hotel I saw a sick or wounded dog on a blanket and I thought it was a veterinarian in the mall. Then I noticed large raw meat near the dog and realized they were killing dogs for food."

        "Crossing to Meaty Coffee. I'm in a field there is a Hindu guy working on a path across the muddy stream to leave the field. The first time I want to go he is very helpful, stops what he is doing, and clears a way for me. The next time when I want to leave with nick he is less helpful. We talk for a long time and he says i cant go across his bridge this time. Nick is already on his bridge, so he walks across. I try to go across the same way but the bridge bends and my foot gets very muddy. I end up running and jumping across. Nick and I go to Starbucks and there is meat everywhere. We decide to go somewhere else. We go to a place where nick buys a large box of coffee that comes with a bag of raw meat and a bag of raw dough in the box. One worker is surprised that the other one uses a bag of raw dough. I go to another place, alone, to get a large hot black coffee for someone and an ice latte or something for myself. The worker barely fill mine, and they can't figure out how to get hot coffee without burning themself because the coffee dispenser needs pushed up at the nozzle. I suggest using chopsticks and it works. They try to charge me 9$ for both coffees even though mine is almost empty, I complain and they say I have to do trivia or some contest to get mine full. I do whatever I needed to, and end up getting both coffees."
